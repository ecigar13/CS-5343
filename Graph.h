//1. Write a program to do BFS traversal of a graph.
//
//You will first create a graph.Use Adjacency Matrix for graph representation.You may use a queue library to do the traversal.The graph must have at least 10 nodes and 15 edges.
//
//Submit screen shot of execution of the program.Also draw the graph on a paper and scan it and submitt it to show the graph you are doing BFS on.
//2. Write a program that returns true if the graph is strongly connected.Else it returns true.
//
//Create the graph as in 1. above, using adjacency matrix.
//
//run the program on two graphs.A strongly connected graph and also a graph not strongly connected.Submit screen shot of execution for both the graphs.Also submit scanned copies of the graph.
